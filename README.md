# Roman Empire map (100 - 300 AD)
Hello everyone, this is a visualization of a map of Roman cities using Plotly and Mapbox. To use custom maps, you need to register on mapbox and get a token (100,000 free uses). The personal token must be written to mapbox_tkn.txt and imported (you can directly write it into the code, but then everyone will see it and be able to use it).

Dataset from: http://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/cities/

The largest cities are highlighted on the map, each city (except for very large ones) has a list of monuments in the description.
